WHOLE AGREEMENT&lt;/b&gt;\n\nThese terms and conditions constitute the whole agreement between the parties and no party shall be bound by any undertakings, representations, warranties, promises or the like not recorded herein. \n\n&lt;b&gt;10.   NO WAIVER&lt;/b&gt;\n\nFailure or neglect by the NRF to fully enforce at any time any of its rights or any of the provisions of this agreement, shall not be construed as a waiver of its rights, nor shall such failure or neglect in any way act as an estoppel or effect the validity of the whole or any part of these terms and conditions, nor prejudice the NRF’s rights to take any action which may have arisen in the past or which may arise in the future. \n\n&lt;b&gt;11.    VARIATION&lt;/b&gt;\n\n1. The NRF reserves the right to change the content, presentation, format, performance, layout, facilities and services available or displayed on this website or any part thereof at its sole discretion and hereby disclaim all liability, losses, claims, damages or inconvenience which may be suffered by any person as a result of such changes.\n\n2.

SEVERABILITY&lt;/b&gt; \n\nIn the event that any of the terms of this Agreement are found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, such terms will be separable from the remaining terms, which shall continue to be valid and enforceable. \n\n&lt;b&gt;13.   CESSION AND DELEGATION&lt;/b&gt;\n\n1. The User shall not cede any of his/her rights nor delegate any of his/her obligations in terms of these terms and conditions.\n\n2.
